Lead Management App

This is a simple full-stack Lead Management application that I built as part of a Software Developer Intern assignment.

The goal of this project was to practice frontend basics, backend APIs, and connecting both together in a clean and understandable way.

## What this app does

- Allows users to enter lead details using a form
- Performs basic validation (required fields, valid email, 10-digit phone number)
- Displays submitted leads in a table
- Stores lead data on the backend and fetches it using APIs

I focused more on (clarity and correctness) rather than adding too many features.


## Tech stack used

**Frontend**
- HTML
- CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript

**Backend**
- Node.js
- Express.js
- CORS

No frameworks were used on the frontend to keep things simple and easy to understand.

## How the project is structured

- frontend/ – UI, form handling, and API calls
- backend/ – Server, routes, and data handling
- How to Run the Project Locally
1.Clone the repository
2.Open a terminal and go to the backend folder, then run:
cd backend
npm install
npm start
This will start the backend server.
3.Open the frontend files in your browser (or use Live Server) to see the app in action
